## The Problem:
Minecarts are useless because they are slow and can't be linked together!

## The Solution:
Linkart! While Linkart doesn't solve slowness, it does solve the second issue! By using a simple chain, you can link minecarts together and have them follow each other till the end of days!

### FAQ:

What's the difference between this version and the older one?

Well, first I've removed the linker item along with that chain. Doing this fixed (at least for me) those weird playerscreenhandler is null crashes.

Also, because this version is based on 2.0.3 players camera works perfectly fine.



### How do I link minecarts together?

Just get a bunch of chains and SHIFT + RMB on your “parent” cart, and then SHIFT + RMB again on your “child” cart. Now the child cart will follow its parent!

### Forge version?

Not by me.

### Requires Fabric API
