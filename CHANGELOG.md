### What's New

This is a pretty big rewrite of the mod.

* This mod no longer requires cloth-config, because the entire modmenu integration was removed.
* Every minecart, from every mod should be supported now.
* `linker_items` tag was renamed to `linkers`.
* The mod should no longer be required on client.
