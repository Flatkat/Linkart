### What's New

* Fixed multiple null pointers.
* Fixed a bunch of linking issues:
  * You can no longer link the leading cart to the tail cart making the train immovable.
  * Fixed ghost relinking which permanently consumed chains.
  * You can no longer link removed minecarts.
  * Fixed a possible memory leak.
  * In general, linking should be way more stable now.
