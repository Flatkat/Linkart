### What's New

* Cherry-picked a fix from [GeeTransit's](https://github.com/GeeTransit/Linkart/tree/audaki-compat) fork for child minecarts falling behind and unlinking when using mods that boost minecarts. ([This does not affect audaki](https://github.com/melontini/Linkart/issues/21) or other mods that replace mincart physics)
* Fixed some other minor issues.
* Dark Matter is now included.
